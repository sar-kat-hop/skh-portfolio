# Challenge 2: Portfolio

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment was to create a portfolio using the concepts learned over the last two weeks in css and html, including responsive design layout (using flex and media queries), accessibility, and "DRY" coding.

The result seen here is a work-in-progress/rough draft that needs some more work but is close to functioning as desired, the main challenge being layout.
