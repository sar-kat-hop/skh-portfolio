                    I'm an aspiring developer.
                    <br>
                    This is my first portfolio. I've just started my journey to learning development so it's a work-in-progress.

                        As a child of the 90s, I was introduced to tech early on. Some of my earliest memories are of playing games on my family's NES and Sega Genesis. Once my family got our first PC when I was 5 or 6, I remember my dad showing me how to use MS Paint. My 5-year-old mind was blown. <span emoji>:D</span>
                        <br>
                        I've been fascinated by the amazing things code can achieve ever since then and have always wanted to not only understand how but do it myself, too.
                        <br>
                        As the first step towards becoming a developer, I'm learning full-stack web development. I'm currently working on improving my html and css, and will be learning JavaScript soon.
                        <br>
                        I'm interested in a wide range of areas including web development, UI/UX design, game development, AI, and more.
